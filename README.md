# Knowledge Graph Construction Use Cases
This repository shows the uses cases from all the participants of the Knowledge Graph Construction Community Group.

## How to include my own use case in the KG-Construction CM?

### Github users:

Option 1 (recommendable):
- Make a fork of the repository to your own personal account.
- Make a copy of the [basic-template.md](https://github.com/kg-construct/use-cases/blob/master/basic-template.md) and change its name to: organization-usecasename.md
- Fill the template with the requested information.
- Make a pull request.

Option 2:
- Create a new issue with the new-use-case template.
- Fill the tempalte and send the issue

### Non-Github users:
- Check the requested information about the use case at [basic-template.md](https://github.com/kg-construct/use-cases/blob/master/basic-template.md) file.
- Send the filled template to the internal mailing list of the group.


## Recommendation for filling the template.

1. The fields of the template are **OPTIONAL**
2. It is highly recommendable to include the links to the resources used for the creation of the KG.
3. If you cannot share some of the resources (e.g. data/mappings) it doesn't matter (better to have the context and challenges than nothing)
4. In context part yo can defined: motivation, domain context, main problems, requeriments. See the examples provided.
