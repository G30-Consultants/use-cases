# Asturian Notaries Manuscripts by WESO and DocuLab Research groups (University of Oviedo)

## Context
Transformation of TEI-based transcriptions of medieval notarial manuscripts in Asturias.

## Challenges
1. There are no usable/natural ids in the provided XML files (there was the need to build artificial ones)
2. Data model is constantly changing, the mapping rules should be easily modified
