# USE CASE Facebook BY IDLab

## Context
The mappings generate RDF from Facebook posts. 
Normally, this should be from the Facebook Graph API, 
but we mocked it for this example, 
because accessing the API for a proof of concept was not feasible.

## Challenges
1. Linking a Facebook profile to a personâ€™s WebID.
