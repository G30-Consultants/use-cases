# USE CASE AI-KG BY The Open University

## Context
The Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Graph (AI-KG) is a large-scale automatically generated knowledge graph that describes 857,658 research entities. AI-KG includes 14M RDF triples and 1,2M statements extracted from 333K research publications in the field of AI and describes 5 types of entities (e.g., tasks, methods, metrics, materials, others) linked by 27 relations. It was designed to support a large variety of intelligent services for analyzing and making sense of research dynamics, supporting researchers in their daily job, and informing decision of founding bodies and research policy makers. AI-KG was generated by applying an automatic pipeline that extracts entities and relationships using three tools: DyGIE++, Stanford CoreNLP, and the CSO Classifier. It then integrates and filters the resulting triples using a combination of deep learning and semantic technologies in order to produce a high quality knowledge graph. 


## Challenges
1. Identifying and merging entities that refer to the same concept.
2. Cleaning up noisy and ambiguous entities.
3. Interlinking AI-KG with other knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata).
4. Verifying consistency and correctness of the statements.
