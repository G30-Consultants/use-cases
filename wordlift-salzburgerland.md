# Building the digital pathways to bring travelers in SalzburgerLand by WordLift

## Context
SalzburgerLand Tourismus is the agency responsible for marketing, development, and **promotion of tourism in the region of Salzburg**. Its main challenge is to attract and engage travelers from around the world, to meet their needs at the right time and to develop new travel products.

The aim of this use case is to show how an **enterprise knowledge graph** can have multiple benefits:
* Improve the effectiveness of a **content marketing** strategy by pushing on search engine optimization
* Allow **content reuse** both by SalzburgerLand and by its business partners in the region
* Organizing existing and new content to **match different search intents**.
Starting from this use case, WordLift has developed an [AI-powered SEO framework for travel brands](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/knowledge-graphs-travel/). 


## Challenges
1. Creating the knowledge graph starting from unstructured content by using NLP
1. Allowing partners to use the knowledge graph for their own business
1. Using the knowledge graph as a means to improve content findability on search engines.
